‚óà **Hello**

   ‚óå *It says 'hello' to you, says how old are you. Also it can print funny comment, but it depends on input.*
   
‚óà **bool –±—É–ª–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π —Ç–∏–ø –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö**

   ‚óå *Here is information about boolean type of values and example of it`s use.*
   
‚óà **for i in range(x, y)**

   ‚óå *Just example of using construction 'for i in range(n‚ÇÅ, n‚ÇÇ)'.*
   
‚óà **range()**

   ‚óå *Example and a little information about class Range.*
   
‚óà **–ë–µ–ª—ã–π —Å–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫**

   ‚óå *Creates a white list, than takes on requests, than accept only that in white list.*
   
‚óà **–ë—É—Ä–≥–µ—Ä**

   ‚óå *Print real fresh burger for you! Bon appetit!)*
   
‚óà **–í–∏–¥—ã –ø–∞—Ä–∞–º–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤**

   ‚óå *Useful information with examples about types of parameters in functions and methods.*
   
‚óà **–í–∏—Å–µ–ª–∏—Ü–∞**

   ‚óå *Funny and quite complicated game to check your vocab! Try to guess a word before all your tries come down!*
   
‚óà **–í–∏—Å–æ–∫–æ—Å–Ω—ã–π –≥–æ–¥**

  ‚óå *You`re entering a year, and programm check is it leap.*
  
‚óà **–í–æ—Å—å–º–æ–π –∑–Ω–∞–∫**

   ‚óå *Actually, I myself still don`t understand what doing this strange programmeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Something with eighth symbol in string.*
